# Search Drive

## Summary

This pet project is due to my need to search if I have uploaded as set of files in google drive. I use google drive ruby
API in order to search for those files.

## Notes

This application uses my [google_authorizer](https://github.com/selemis/google_authorizer).

Before running the file you need to place client_secret.json under the project root folder.
